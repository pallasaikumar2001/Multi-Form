# Multi-Step Form Project

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence.
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections.
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly.
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made.

### What I Learned

This project provided significant insights into the following:
* Form Validation: Implemented form validation for required fields like- email formatting, and step submissions.
* Tailwind CSS: Leveraged utility-first classes to style components, enhancing design efficiency quickly.
* DOM Manipulation: Managed multiple steps dynamically by updating the DOM as the user navigates through the form.
  
This project helped me enhance my skills in working with **Tailwind CSS**.
